                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>At the start of the next week, we had to delete all of the CSS we uused for styling last week. This
                    then enabled me to add essential HTML and CSS, like common structural markup (ex. header, nav,
                    footer, etc.). Next, I made my first three lists on my homepage that are category-based. Two sub
                    pages were then made to keep the home page company (abot.html and blog.htmml). My About page will
                    show you the links to the main rescourses and technologies I used and learned about in class. My
                    Blog page will tell you a short summary of what I completed in class by week. As this week came to a
                    close, I had a live, working web site with three pages: <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io/index.html">Home</a>, <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.uhub.io/about.html">About</a>, and <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io/blog.html">Blog</a>.</p>

            </article>

                <h4>Week 1</h4>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p> The very first thing we did was set up a live website on Githb using an accont Mr.G already created
                    for us. The root username respostitory I created was then named <a
                        href="https://github.com/iwebstudent001/iwebstudent001.github.io">iwebstudent001.github.io</a>.
                    Next, I had to clone my repo and local computer desktop together using the Terminal app. Using a
                    code editor known by the name of VS Code, I edited the readme file (using a langage called
                    markdown). Inside VS Code, I then created an index.html file (the home page) and a style.css file.
                    Each day as class came to an end, I had to save my changes using a procedure where we saved,
                    commited, and pushed using github. Finally, as the week came to an end, there was a live, working
                    website I could call my own: <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io">https://iwebstudent001.github.io</a></p>
