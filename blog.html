                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">07/12/2019</div>
                <p>This week we were given a lot of time to create and perfect our designs on XD. Using the given class
                    time, I created
                    many different designs on XD and put some of them onto the homepage of my website using fancy box.
                    We were encouraged to
                    look on websites such as one page love to get inspiration and examples for our own websites. One day
                    we went out to take
                    our own pictures around campus that we could then use on our website designs. That same day we
                    designed our own logos.
                    After this little lesson, we continued to work on our final projects.</p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">07/05/2019</div>
                <p>The focus of this week was on prototyping our different website designs. To prototype our designs we
                    used Adobe XD. The
                    first thing we did was create and design our sub pages that we then connected to our home page to
                    prototype. We then
                    learned about the different web design terminology like IA, UX, and UI. In this lesson we also
                    learned about the steps
                    web designers typically take to create a professional website. Some of these steps are making
                    wireframes, site maps, and
                    mockups. Using all the information and tools our teacher gave us, we started working on our final
                    projects.</p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">06/28/2019</div>
                <p>This week we focused on computer graphics. We were introduced to the different types of computer
                    graphics such as raster
                    and vector at the beginning of the week. Then, our teacher showed us the digital media software we
                    could used to design
                    these different graphics. The applications he introduced us to all belonged to Adobe. We went deeper
                    into two of these
                    applications. These were Adobe photoshops which is used for raster graphics and Adobe illustrator
                    which is used to
                    design vector graphics. We were then told to play around with these applications and just have fun
                    with them so we could
                    get to know how to use them. Using these digital media softwares applications, we designed and fixed
                    up our original
                    summer logos. Next, we were introduced to Adobe XD, which is used to prototype websites. Using Adobe
                    XD, we got to
                    prototype our own web sites. This is my web site prototype I created using Adobe XD: <a
                        href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/fb016b94-1626-4e37-7326-4c3565ab415d-8d30/">My Prototype</a>.

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>At the start of the next week, we had to delete all of the CSS we uused for styling last week. This
                    then enabled me to add essential HTML and CSS, like common structural markup (ex. header, nav,
                    footer, etc.). Next, I made my first three lists on my homepage that are category-based. Two sub
                    pages were then made to keep the home page company (abot.html and blog.htmml). My About page will
                    show you the links to the main rescourses and technologies I used and learned about in class. My
                    Blog page will tell you a short summary of what I completed in class by week. As this week came to a
                    close, I had a live, working web site with three pages: <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io/index.html">Home</a>, <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.uhub.io/about.html">About</a>, and <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io/blog.html">Blog</a>.</p>

                <h4>Week 1</h4>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p> The very first thing we did was set up a live website on Githb using an accont Mr.G already created
                    for us. The root username respostitory I created was then named <a
                        href="https://github.com/iwebstudent001/iwebstudent001.github.io">iwebstudent001.github.io</a>.
                    Next, I had to clone my repo and local computer desktop together using the Terminal app. Using a
                    code editor known by the name of VS Code, I edited the readme file (using a langage called
                    markdown). Inside VS Code, I then created an index.html file (the home page) and a style.css file.
                    Each day as class came to an end, I had to save my changes using a procedure where we saved,
                    commited, and pushed using github. Finally, as the week came to an end, there was a live, working
                    website I could call my own: <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io">https://iwebstudent001.github.io</a></p>
